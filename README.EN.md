## ðŸ“– Introduction

Dynamic form solution based on React and JSONSchema.

Drip-Form uses **JSON configuration files** to generate forms with **data linkage, complex verification, asynchronous requests, and nesting**, which can reduce complex and redundant form development work.

The use of supporting **visual form generator and Node verification** tool can further improve the efficiency of form development.

Drip-Form has the following five âœ¨highlightsâœ¨:

- **Automation**ï¼šAccording to the form data, the initialization form can be automatically generated.
- **Semantic**ï¼šConcise and efficient JSON protocol helps developers understand.
- **Integrated verification**ï¼šRelying on `ajv`'s standardized verification capabilities, it can achieve integrated front-end and back-end verification.
- **Visualization**ï¼šVisually build and modify the form `Schema`.
- **Extensible**ï¼šSupport secondary development, expandable custom component set and verification set.
